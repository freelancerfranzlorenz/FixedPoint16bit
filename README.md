# Fixed Point 16 Bit

If you have a small microcontroller and you want to multiply a
16 bit value with a floating point number, then you have two
choices:
- Bind in the floating point lib of your uc vendor and waste memory and time :-(
- Calculate with shifts and adds :-) more efficient!

This html site helps you to find the right shifts and adds
for your arithmic problem.

# How this script works

2. Put in your floating point factor or a mathemical formular in the input field.
